You can find the report associated with the project named "...pdf". 

# How to reproduce the code ?
The Exploration section of the project is in the "Exploration.ipynb" file.
You can run cells after cells to get the same depicted results. 
A PCA representation of the raw data is in the "PCA.ipynb" file. 

The Linear Method section results are in the "Linear_Methods.ipynb" file. It contains the regularization methods, and the Forward Selection method. 

The Non Linear Method section is divided in files corresponding to each method :
